# Manual test file to verify LLL completion
# Open this file in VS Code with the SageMath Enhanced extension
# Type these incomplete function names and press Ctrl+Space for completion

# Test 1: Type "LLL" and it should autocomplete the LLL function
# LLL

# Test 2: Type "BKZ" and it should autocomplete the BKZ function  
# BKZ

# Test 3: Type "legendre_" and it should show legendre_symbol
# legendre_

# Test 4: Type "hermite_" and it should show hermite_form
# hermite_

# Test 5: Type "FiniteF" and it should show FiniteField
# FiniteF

# Test 6: Type "QuaternionA" and it should show QuaternionAlgebra
# QuaternionA

# All of these should now work with the completion system!
