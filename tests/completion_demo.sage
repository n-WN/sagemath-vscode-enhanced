# SageMath Enhanced - Completion Demonstration
# This file demonstrates the improved completion functionality

# Before: typing "Polyno" would not suggest "PolynomialRing"
# After: typing "Polyno" now suggests "PolynomialRing" ✅

# Test Case 1: Polynomial Ring Creation
# Try typing "Polyno" and press Ctrl+Space - should suggest PolynomialRing
R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')
x = R.gen()
p = x^3 + 2*x + 1

# Test Case 2: Alternative partial typing
# Try typing "PolyRin" - should also suggest PolynomialRing
S = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'y')
y = S.gen()

# Test Case 3: Other function completions
# Try typing "Ell" - should suggest EllipticCurve
E = EllipticCurve([0, 0, 0, -1, 0])

# Try typing "mat" - should suggest matrix functions
M = matrix(QQ, [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
I = identity_matrix(QQ, 3)

# Try typing "pl" - should suggest plot functions
plot(sin(x), (x, 0, 2*pi))

# Try typing "is_pr" - should suggest is_prime
print(is_prime(17))

# Try typing "Gr" - should suggest Graph
G = Graph()
G.add_vertices([1, 2, 3, 4])
