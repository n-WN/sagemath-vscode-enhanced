# Implementation Summary: SageMath Notebook Support

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive notebook support for the SageMath VS Code extension, addressing the user request for SageMath code highlighting and execution in Jupyter notebooks.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Notebook Kernel Support
- **`SageMathNotebookController`**: A dedicated notebook controller class that:
  - Registers as a notebook kernel for Jupyter notebooks
  - Supports both 'sage' and 'python' languages
  - Provides execution ordering and proper cell lifecycle management
  - Handles temporary file creation and cleanup

### 2. Code Execution
- **Cell Execution Engine**: 
  - Creates temporary .sage files for each cell
  - Executes using the configured SageMath interpreter
  - Handles both stdout and stderr output
  - Supports existing WSL configuration for Windows users
  - Automatic cleanup of temporary files (.sage and .sage.py)

### 3. Configuration
- **New Settings**:
  - `sagemathEnhanced.notebookKernelEnabled`: Enable/disable notebook kernel
  - Reuses existing interpreter path and WSL settings
  
### 4. Error Handling
- **Robust Error Management**:
  - Displays execution errors in notebook cell outputs
  - Handles timeout scenarios (30-second limit)
  - Provides informative error messages
  - Graceful handling of missing SageMath installation

### 5. Integration
- **Seamless Extension Integration**:
  - Added notebook controller to main extension activation
  - Maintains compatibility with existing .sage file functionality
  - Proper disposal and cleanup on extension deactivation

## Package.json Updates
- Added `notebooks` contribution for Jupyter notebook support
- Extended grammar support for notebook contexts
- Added new configuration properties
- Maintained backward compatibility

## Documentation
- **Updated README.md**: Added notebook usage instructions and features
- **Created NOTEBOOK_SUPPORT.md**: Comprehensive guide for notebook functionality
- **Sample Notebook**: Created `test-notebook.ipynb` with diverse examples

## Testing
- Enhanced test suite with extension activation tests
- Created comprehensive test notebook with various SageMath examples
- Verified TypeScript compilation and build process

## Key Benefits
1. **Syntax Highlighting**: SageMath syntax highlighting automatically works in notebook cells
2. **IntelliSense Support**: Language features extend to notebook context
3. **Execution Integration**: Uses existing SageMath runner infrastructure
4. **Configuration Consistency**: Respects all existing extension settings
5. **Error Feedback**: Clear error reporting for debugging
6. **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows (with WSL), macOS, and Linux

## File Structure

```

## User Experience
Users can now:
1. Open .ipynb files in VS Code
2. Select "SageMath" from the kernel picker
3. Write SageMath code with syntax highlighting
4. Execute cells and see output directly in notebooks
5. Debug errors with proper error reporting
6. Use all existing extension configuration options

This implementation provides a complete notebook experience that integrates seamlessly with the existing SageMath Enhanced extension functionality.
